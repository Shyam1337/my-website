            <h4>Travel Insurance</h4>
            <p>
              Comprehensive travel insurance is a mandatory requirement for all participants joining our treks. Your policy must specifically cover high-altitude trekking and provide protection against the unique risks associated with Himalayan travel.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Emergency helicopter evacuation up to at least 6,000 meters</li>
              <li>Medical treatment and hospitalization in Nepal</li>
              <li>Trip cancellation, delay, or interruption</li>
              <li>Personal liability coverage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Be aware that many standard policies only cover evacuations up to 4,000 meters. If you're trekking or climbing at higher elevations, make sure your policy includes coverage up to 6,000 meters, and if applicable, includes "climbing" or "mountaineering" as an activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some insurance providers require you to pay evacuation or medical expenses upfront in Nepal and will reimburse you later. As helicopter evacuations can cost up to $5,000 USD, we recommend confirming whether your provider offers direct billing or requires out-of-pocket payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              You only need coverage for the days you’ll be actively trekking. We strongly encourage contacting your insurance company before traveling to confirm the specifics of your policy. Above & Beyond Trekking does not endorse any particular provider, but we are happy to offer guidance upon request.
            </p>

          <div class="itinerary-item">
            <h4>Booking & Payment</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> 25% of the trip cost is required at the time of booking.</li>
              <li><strong>Final Payment:</strong> Due upon arrival in Nepal, before the trek starts.</li>
              <li><strong>Accepted Payments:</strong> Bank transfer, credit/debit card, or cash (USD, EUR, or NPR).</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
  
          <div class="itinerary-item">
            <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
            <p><strong>By You:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>More than 30 days before departure: Deposit retained</li>
              <li>15–29 days: 50% cancellation fee</li>
              <li>Less than 15 days: 100% cancellation fee</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>By Us:</strong> If we cancel your trip for any reason, you will receive a full refund or credit toward a future departure.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="itinerary-item">
            <h4>Delays & Changes</h4>
            <p>
              Weather conditions in the Himalayas are unpredictable, and flight schedules, particularly to Lukla, can experience significant delays or cancellations. Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla, where the Everest Base Camp trek begins, are often affected by these factors and may be postponed for several days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to ongoing upgrades at Kathmandu Airport, Lukla flights may also be rerouted to Ramechhap Airport, located about a 4-hour drive from Kathmandu. If this occurs, we will arrange transportation at no extra cost to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event of a flight cancellation, we will rebook you for the next available flight. Should a helicopter option be required, we will attempt to secure one, but the additional cost (around $400 or more) will be the responsibility of the traveler. If you take a helicopter instead of the scheduled flight, we will refund $150 of your flight fare ($110 for Indian Nationals). Please collect your refund at our Kathmandu office.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Key Points to Keep in Mind:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Flight bookings will be made shortly after receiving your deposit and passport details. Please send these as soon as possible to secure your flight.</li>
              <li>If your flight is cancelled due to weather, we will rebook for the next available day. During peak seasons, priority flights may already be fully booked, which may result in a delay.</li>
              <li>Helicopter availability depends on weather, other bookings, and rescue operations. We will do our best to arrange one, but availability is not guaranteed.</li>
              <li>Helicopter prices fluctuate based on demand, and local staff may offer different prices than we quote. We recommend booking early to secure the best rate.</li>
              <li>If helicopters are unavailable, we may offer an alternative flight to Phaplu, followed by a jeep ride (10-14 hours) back to Kathmandu. If you have extra time in Nepal, waiting for the weather to clear in Lukla might be a better option.</li>
              <li>Flight and helicopter schedules are subject to change, and our team will provide you with the most up-to-date information and support as conditions evolve.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="itinerary-item">
            <h4>Exclusions & Extra Costs</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Visa fees: $30 USD for 15 days, $50 USD for 30 days, or $125 USD for 90 days (or equivalent in convertible foreign currency)</li>
              <li>Rental gear (sleeping bags/down jackets: ~$12 each)</li>
              <li>Meals in Kathmandu (only breakfast included)</li>
              <li>Tipping (recommended: $80+)</li>
              <li>Bottled water on trek ($1–$3 per bottle)</li>
              <li>Wi-Fi, hot showers, and device charging during trek</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For a cost-effective option, bring or buy water purification tablets (~$2 in Kathmandu).</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="itinerary-item">
            <h4>Acclimatization & Altitude Sickness</h4>
            <p>
              Trekking in Nepal often involves reaching elevations above 3,000 meters (9,800 feet), where the risk of altitude sickness—also known as Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)—increases. Symptoms can include headache, nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Severe cases can lead to life-threatening conditions such as High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) or High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE).
            </p>
            <p>
              To minimize the risk, our itineraries are carefully designed with built-in acclimatization days and gradual altitude gain. However, every individual responds differently to altitude. It is essential that you listen to your body, communicate with your guide, and follow their advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              If symptoms of altitude sickness become severe, it may be necessary to descend or evacuate. Your safety is our top priority, and your guide is trained to recognize and manage these conditions. Please note that any costs associated with evacuation or early descent are the responsibility of the traveler and should be covered by your travel insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recommend consulting with your doctor before traveling and learning about preventative options such as Diamox (Acetazolamide), a common medication used to prevent and treat altitude sickness.
            </p>
          </div>
           
      
          <div class="itinerary-item">
            <h4>Fitness for Trekking in Nepal</h4>
            <p>
              Trekking in Nepal offers breathtaking scenery and unforgettable experiences—but it also demands a good level of physical fitness. Most treks, especially those at higher altitudes like Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Circuit, or Langtang Valley, require several hours of walking each day on uneven terrain, often at elevations exceeding 3,000 meters (10,000 feet).
            </p>
            <p>
              While you don’t need to be an elite athlete, good cardiovascular health, leg strength, and endurance are essential. We recommend beginning a fitness routine at least 6–8 weeks before your trek that includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hiking or walking with a backpack</strong> to simulate actual trekking conditions</li>
              <li><strong>Cardio workouts</strong> such as running, cycling, or stair climbing</li>
              <li><strong>Strength training</strong>, particularly for legs and core</li>
              <li><strong>Stretching and mobility</strong> exercises to improve flexibility and prevent injury</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you have any pre-existing medical conditions or concerns about your fitness level, consult with your doctor before booking your trek. It’s also wise to discuss altitude considerations and whether you're fit to travel at elevations over 3,500 meters.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more technical treks or climbs, additional preparation—including previous trekking or mountaineering experience—may be required. Above & Beyond Trekking offers guidance and support for choosing a trek that matches your fitness level and goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your safety and enjoyment are our top priorities. With the right preparation, trekking in Nepal can be a life-changing adventure you'll never forget!

          <div class="itinerary-item">
            <h4>Early Trek Termination</h4>
            <p>
              While we hope your journey in the Himalayas goes exactly as planned, we understand that some trekkers may need to end their trek earlier than expected due to personal, medical, or other unforeseen reasons. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that Above & Beyond Trekking is unable to offer refunds for any unused days or services once the trek has commenced. This is because our operational costs remain fixed—we are committed to compensating our guides, porters, and support staff for their scheduled time and efforts, regardless of changes to the itinerary.
            </p>
            <p>
              We appreciate your understanding and encourage all trekkers to have comprehensive travel insurance that covers trip interruption in case you need to leave the trek early.

            <h4>Passport & Visa Requirements</h4>
            <p>
              Ensure your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry into Nepal. Tourist visas can be obtained on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport or at any Nepali embassy abroad.

            <h4>Service Refusal</h4>
            <p>
              Above & Beyond Trekking reserves the right to refuse service at any point—whether in Kathmandu or during the trek—if a participant’s behavior compromises the safety, comfort, or well-being of others. This includes but is not limited to fighting, excessive alcohol consumption, or verbal abuse toward fellow trekkers, guides, or staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such behavior is strictly unacceptable and may result in immediate termination of services without refund. We kindly ask all guests to treat our team and fellow travelers with respect to ensure a positive and supportive environment throughout the journey.
